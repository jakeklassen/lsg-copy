# lsg-copy

Developed with node@12

Check your clipboard :smiley:

## Tests

**Requirements:**

- `npm` is installed - I haven't tested aggressively against specific versions

Tests assume you have `npm` installed. The [noop3](https://www.npmjs.com/package/noop3) package is installed globally in case no packages are installed.
